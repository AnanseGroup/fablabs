        %p Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for invention. They began as an outreach project from MITâ€™s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find more information about Fab Labs on the #{link_to "Fab Foundation Website", "#"}.
